![Task4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2913d0a7-91d1-477c-b31b-86daed98604e)

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis is performed to classify the polarity of social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualizations help illustrate trends, providing actionable insights into how people feel about a brand or topic over time.

# Libraries Used
* Pandas for data manipulation
* TextBlob for sentiment analysis
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Numpy for numerical operations

# Steps Followed
1. Data Collection: Import datasets.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate data.
3. Modeling: Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

# Knowledge Gained
* Hands-on experience with sentiment analysis using TextBlob.
* Improved skills in data preprocessing and cleaning social media data.
* Gained proficiency in creating visualizations with Matplotlib to present sentiment trends.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can extract valuable insights from social media data, helping businesses understand public opinion and improve strategies.
